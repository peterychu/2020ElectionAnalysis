We want to be able to know if certain counties with more or less farmland vote more red or blue. According to many polls, farmers have tended to lean towards the Reublican party in recent history, so we want to see if there is enough of a presence of farmers in Iowa such that the state is majority red, or if the majority of people there vote for another party. We will further explore the relationship between the ammount of farmland and voting patterns by examining the smallest state in relation to farmland Rhode Island and comparing it to Iowa, the largest

It will be interesting to see what Texas's and Missouri's voting habits will look like.

It appears to be that people who tend to vote in this state tend to not identify as Republican. \n    \n    Being the state with the least amount of land dedicated to farming, we assumed that this state would not have many Republican votes. This is due to our prior belief that states with more dedicated farmland would have a larger number of Republican voters. This regression model does appear to support that idea because no matter the values inputted for our predictions, we seemed to always get people who were either Non-Partisan or Democratic with very few people being Republican. This is especially evident when compared to the model in Iowa where people were predicted to vote Republican in most cases with those with more land, and bigger homes being more likely to. \n    \n    This means that we can say that there potentially could be a relationship between land dedciated to farming within a state and how people within that state votes."}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "5b340044-c577-46c1-9068-5eec006ba461", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ""}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "PySpark", "language": "python", "name": "pyspark"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.8.15"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 5}
